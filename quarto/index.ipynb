    "# Hello Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the tutorial on using the VR Data Science/Marketing Developers template repository. This guide will show you how to quickly start using our simple yet cost-efficient framework with the provided template. The repository includes a basic statefarm that embodies good standard CI/CD practices, allowing you to focus more on development and less on cloud execution details.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning:** At the time of this writing, the DTSC developer does not have access to the Reporting and Data Enablement (RDE) account. Therefore, we must ensure compatibility across GitHub organizations. However, this does not impact the process described here. The DTSC team is ready to move this repo to the RDE space if necessary.\n",

    "# High-Level Architecture Review \n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation provides an overview of the automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow implemented using Azure services and infrastructure-as-code practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Typical Workflow](./images/ci_cd_workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding your current limitation with APPI containers and the inability to use Docker in your workflow, it's clear that transitioning to leveraging an on-premise cluster for Docker-based operations would offer significant benefits. This shift would not only reduce dependency on GitHub runners but also enhance the efficiency and control over your CI/CD pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Typical Workflow](./images/ci_cd_workflow2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Repository:** Developers push their code to the `Repo`, where the version control is managed.\n",
    "- **CI Pipeline:** Triggered by code commits, `GitHub Actions` automate the execution of tests to validate code quality.\n",
    "- **Automated Testing:** `Pytest` is used to run unit and integration tests ensuring that new changes adhere to our quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Infrastructure Provisioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Terraform Apply:** Post-testing, `Terraform` provisions predefined infrastructure on Azure, creating the required virtual machines (VMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build and Deployment/Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Docker Build:** A Docker container image is built with the latest codebase.\n",
    "- **ACR Storage:** The Docker image is stored in `Azure Container Registry (ACR)` for versioning and management.\n",
    "- **Python Execution:** The Docker image is then pulled onto the Azure VMs where the `Python` code is executed within a controlled environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Terraform Destroy:** After the execution, `Terraform` is used again to tear down the infrastructure, removing the VMs and preventing unnecessary costs and resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagram Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of operations in the CI/CD process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Repository Update:** `Repo` > `GitHub Actions`\n",
    "2. **Automated Testing:** `GitHub Actions` > `Pytest`\n",
    "3. **Infrastructure Provisioning:** `Pytest` > `Terraform Apply`\n",
    "4. **VM Creation:** `Terraform Apply` > `VM 1, VM 2, VM 3`\n",
    "5. **Container Image Build:** `VM Group` > `Docker Build`\n",
    "6. **Image Storage:** `Docker Build` > `ACR`\n",
    "7. **Script Execution:** `ACR` > `VM (Python Execution)`\n",
    "8. **Infrastructure Cleanup:** `VM (Python Execution)` > `Terraform Destroy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is automated and occurs sequentially, ensuring a smooth transition from code commit to deployment and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps To Create a New Repo in GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to create a new repository using the template:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Access Your Organization's Homepage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to the homepage of your organization on GitHub.\n",
    "- Click the \"New\" button to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Github Homepage](./images/template_repo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Select the `azure-vm-template`\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the list of available templates, select `azure-vm-template`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Select Template](./images/template_repo_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note: More templates will be added in the future as we finalize our cloud tool selections and large DDR (Data-Driven Reporting) decisions. These choices will shape our future options. Additionally, more efficient methods will be developed once we have access to a new cloud subscription, enabling basic cloud features like key vaults and container apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Change Project Name\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating statefarm folder to Project Name\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rename your folder to the library name you want it to be for statefarm statefarm --> LTR for the project here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Project Name in Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "[tool.poetry]\n",
    "name = \"statefarm\"\n",
    "version = \"0.1.0\"\n",
    "description = \"statefarm for Vail Marketing Developer to Transition for Gitlab to Github MVP\"\n",
    "authors = [\"JeremyDemlow <Jeremy.Demlow@vailresorts.com>\"]\n",
    "readme = \"README.md\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "[tool.poetry]\n",
    "name = \"NEWPROJECTNAME\"\n",
    "version = \"0.1.0\" # Bumping a project can be found in MLE and DSU this isn't something we currently do for projects\n",
    "description = \"Describe Your Project\"\n",
    "authors = [\"DeveloperName <First.Last@vailresorts.com>\"]\n",
    "readme = \"README.md\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Project Name in Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "When adapting this Dockerfile for a new repository, the key change involves the lines where your project files are copied. Here are the specific lines to update:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lines 48-50 and 85-87: Project Files**\n",
    "  - Original lines:\n",
    "    ```dockerfile\n",
    "    COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./\n",
    "    COPY statefarm/ ./statefarm/\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Change these lines to reference the appropriate files and directories from your new repository.\n",
    "  - Replace `statefarm/` with the directory name of your new project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Happy Developing\n",
    "\n",
    "This template should cover about 80% of your typical project needs, similar to what we've been doing in GitLab. As we continue to use and refine this template, we'll identify and address any unknowns or imperfections to enhance the developer experience at Vail Resorts. It's important to remember that the repository includes tests and documentation specific to the template. You'll need to remove or modify these for your project's context, but detailed instructions for doing so aren't necessary in this documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures a streamlined and efficient setup for new projects, allowing developers to focus more on development and less on configuration."
